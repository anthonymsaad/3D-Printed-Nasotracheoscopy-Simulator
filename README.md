# 3D-Printed-Nasotracheoscopy-Simulator

An open-source, low-cost, high-fidelity simulator developed to train medical learners in flexible nasotracheoscopy, a core skill across multiple specialties including otolaryngology, anesthesia, and critical care. This 3D Nasotracheoscopy Simulator includes a head-and-neck manikin with anatomically accurate upper airway structures derived from patient CT imaging. The nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, and larynx are reproduced in detail, and the larynx is motorized to simulate phonatory movement. The design allows for insertion of a flexible nasoendoscope to practice endoscopic navigation, anatomic recognition, and dynamic airway evaluation. The modular build enables easy printing with PLA filament and can be assembled without specialized tools.
